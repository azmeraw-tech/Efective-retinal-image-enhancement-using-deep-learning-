# Effective-Retinal-image-enhancement

This project considers a convolutional neural network for retinal image quality enhancement using faster and deeper convolutional neural networks that can be trained for either image super-resolution or image enhancement or both. The model aims to train under low resolution and downsampled conditions without losing information in order to improve the model's performance. Finally, we apply an ablation study comparing the bicubic model with our model, and our model achieves better PSNR results at each scale.
